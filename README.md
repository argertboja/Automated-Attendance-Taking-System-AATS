# Automated-Attendance-Taking-System-AATS

### Description:
<p>This project aims to improve the methods of attendance taking, which will lead to less  responsibilities  for  instructors  and  more  accuracy  for  students.  By  using  face recognition, we will be able to identify all the students present in class. Furthermore, by  conducting  several  checks  through  the  class  hour  there  will  be  no  possibility  of cheating.  Both  students  and  instructors  will  be  able  to  check  the  results  on  an application that will be build. Even if there is any inaccuracy, the students will be able 
to still be counted as present by letting their professor know that they were present in the taken picture. In this way, the new data will be collected and the system will be trained again in order to adapt to individuals changing their look.
